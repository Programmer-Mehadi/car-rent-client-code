It is backed up by an IMA hybrid system that develops 20 HP (15 kW) and 78 Nm (58 lb-ft) of torque.The top speed of the CR-Z wasn't dizzying, but 124 mph showed it wasn't exactly a slouch either. The punch the hybrid system gave as you put your foot down was quite impressive as well, although its 0-62 mph time was a little slow at 9.9 seconds.",
